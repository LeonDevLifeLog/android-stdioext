Android stdioext library
========================

This repository contains C functions to access a memory buffer as a FILE, such as `fmemopen()` and `open_memstream()`.

The code has been taken from [Tesseract Tools for Android](https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-android-tools/) in order to provide a project independent version of the functions.

An Android makefile is provided to help building the library.
